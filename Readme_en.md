## üéØ Service Description  

- Periodically **monitors product prices and discounts** on multiple overseas boutique websites  
- Sends **Discord alerts** when price/discount changes are detected  
- Cross-checks products on KREAM (domestic resale platform) and sends an additional alert if profit margin exceeds a configured threshold  
- When a specific product code is uploaded and managed in the Admin panel, if the price/quantity matches configured conditions, the app **automatically places an order on the boutique site**

## üß† Technical Challenges & Solutions  

### 0. Stability of UI-Dependent Crawling Logic  
- Stored external site HTML snapshots for **regression testing**  
- Split into **unit tests** (service layer) and **integration tests** (actual site interactions)  

### 1. Monitoring Multiple Sites Simultaneously  
- Used Spring `@Scheduled` + Java Thread Pool for **parallel execution**  

### 2. Normalizing Product Code Formats  
- Different product code formats per site unified via a **Converting Layer**  
- Mapping is loaded from configuration files at startup  

### 3. Anti-Bot Evasion  
- Applied **think time** between requests  
- **Rotated User-Agent / Cookies**  
- Configured ChromeDriver to mimic normal user behavior  
- Used **VPN/Proxy**  

### 4. Testing Strategy Separation  
- **Core logic**: covered with unit tests by removing external dependencies  
- **Integration parts**: validated with real-world interactions via integration tests  

### 5. Resource/Performance Optimization  
- Minimized **DB access**, prioritized in-memory comparison logic  
- Stored only necessary data in **file-based storage (DB alternative)**  
- Used **Scouter APM** to monitor Heap / Young GC

## ‚úÖ Quality Assurance & Reliability  

- **Snapshot-based regression tests** to detect UI changes  
- **Smoke tests** to verify pipeline health  
- Leveraged Discord alert channels for **operational monitoring**
